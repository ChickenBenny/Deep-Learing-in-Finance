# Stacked Autoencoder with LSTM to predict stock price
In this project, I will use autoencoder to compress the data and use LSTM model try to predict the future price. Last I will use backtesting to evaluate each strategy.

### Workflow

### Autoencoder
Autoencoders are an unsupervised learning technique, although they are trained using supervised learning methods. The goal is to minimize reconstruction error based on a loss function, such as the mean squared error.

* What auoencoder can do?
  1. Dimensionality reduction
  2. Feature extraction
  3. Denoise data
  4. Fill up missing data
